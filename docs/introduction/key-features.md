# Key Features

## 🎯 What Makes MiniGarage Unique

MiniGarage is a **Base Mini App** that combines gacha mechanics, NFT ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) scarcity into a single collectible experience.

The platform is designed to be **easy to access**, **fair to play**, and **trustworthy to collect**.

---

## 1. 🎰 Gacha System with Real Ownership (Live on Testnet)

MiniGarage uses a gacha system where **every outcome results in on-chain ownership**.

![Gacha](gacha-system.png)
**Key Properties:**
*   ✅ Every gacha roll produces an NFT
*   ✅ Assets are owned by the user, not the platform
*   ✅ NFTs remain valid even if the app is unavailable

---

## 2. 🧩 Fragment Crafting (Guaranteed Progression)

MiniGarage avoids pure RNG frustration by introducing fragment-based progression.

*   **Traditional Gacha:** Roll → Random Result → No Guarantee ❌
*   **MiniGarage:** Roll → Fragment → Progress → Guaranteed Car ✅

### How It Works

1.  Gacha may return a fragment instead of a full car.
2.  Collect a full set of fragments of the same tier.
3.  Assemble fragments to mint a guaranteed car NFT.
4.  Fragments are tradeable NFTs.

> This ensures that every roll contributes toward a meaningful outcome.

---

## 3. 🏪 Peer-to-Peer Marketplace

Collectors can trade NFTs directly with each other inside the MiniGarage ecosystem.

**Marketplace Characteristics:**
*   Peer-to-peer trading.
*   No inflation of supply.
*   Transparent price discovery.
*   Gas-abstracted transactions.

> Marketplace activity does not affect total NFT supply.

---

## 4. 🌍 Real-World Asset (RWA) Bridge (Roadmap)

Each NFT car is designed to represent a limited physical collectible.

**Planned RWA Flow:**
`NFT Ownership` → `Burn NFT` → `Claim Physical Asset`

**Design Principles:**
*   NFT minting is capped by real-world asset supply.
*   Each NFT can be redeemed only once.
*   Redemption requires on-chain burning.
*   Prevents double-claims and oversupply.

> This model connects digital collecting with real-world scarcity in a verifiable way.

## 5. ⚡ Gas-Abstracted Experience with IDRX

MiniGarage abstracts gas fees using an in-app token model.
