# Key Features

## 🎯 What Makes MiniGarage Unique

MiniGarage is a **Base Mini App** that combines gacha mechanics, NFT ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) scarcity into a single collectible experience.

The platform is designed to be **easy to access**, **fair to play**, and **trustworthy to collect**.

## 1. 🎰 Gacha System with Real Ownership (Live on Testnet)

MiniGarage uses a gacha system where **every outcome results in on-chain ownership**.

![Gacha](gacha-system.png)
Key Properties

Every gacha roll produces an NFT

Assets are owned by the user, not the platform

NFTs remain valid even if the app is unavailable

2. 🧩 Fragment Crafting (Guaranteed Progression) (Live on Testnet)
MiniGarage avoids pure RNG frustration by introducing fragment-based progression.

Traditional Gacha:
Roll → Random Result → No Guarantee ❌

MiniGarage:
Roll → Fragment → Progress → Guaranteed Car ✅
How It Works

Gacha may return a fragment instead of a full car

Collect a full set of fragments of the same tier

Assemble fragments to mint a guaranteed car NFT

Fragments are tradeable NFTs

This ensures that every roll contributes toward a meaningful outcome.

3. 🏪 Peer-to-Peer Marketplace (Live on Testnet)
Collectors can trade NFTs directly with each other inside the MiniGarage ecosystem.

Marketplace Characteristics

Peer-to-peer trading

No inflation of supply

Transparent price discovery

Gas-abstracted transactions

Marketplace activity does not affect total NFT supply.

4. 🌍 Real-World Asset (RWA) Bridge (Roadmap)
Each NFT car is designed to represent a limited physical collectible.

Planned RWA Flow

NFT Ownership → Burn NFT → Claim Physical Asset
Design Principles

NFT minting is capped by real-world asset supply

Each NFT can be redeemed only once

Redemption requires on-chain burning

Prevents double-claims and oversupply

This model connects digital collecting with real-world scarcity in a verifiable way.

5. ⚡ Gas-Abstracted Experience with IDRX (Live on Testnet)
MiniGarage abstracts gas fees using an in-app token model.

6. 🔐 Seamless Access via Base Mini App (Live)
