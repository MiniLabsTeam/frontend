# Why Base?

## ⚡ Overview

MiniGarage is currently built on **Base Sepolia (testnet)** with a planned migration to **Base Mainnet**.  
Base is chosen because it provides the best balance between **cost efficiency, performance, developer experience, and user onboarding** for a consumer-focused NFT and gacha platform.

---

## 🔍 Selection Criteria

When selecting a blockchain for MiniGarage, we evaluated networks based on the following priorities:

| Criterion | Priority |
|:---|:---|
| Transaction Cost | High |
| Speed & Finality | High |
| Developer Experience | Medium |
| Ecosystem & Adoption | Medium |
| User Onboarding | High |

Base consistently ranked highest across these criteria.

## ✅ Why Base

### 1. Low and Predictable Transaction Costs

Frequent actions such as gacha rolls, fragment assembly, and NFT transfers require **low-cost transactions** to remain accessible.

</tbody>
</table>

**Example Scenario:**
*   **Ethereum L1:** High and unpredictable gas costs (unsuitable for repeated interactions).
*   **Base:** Orders of magnitude cheaper with consistent fees.

This cost structure enables MiniGarage to offer a gas-abstracted user experience without sacrificing decentralization.

### 2. Fast Finality for Better User Experience

Base offers fast block times (~2 seconds), which is well-suited for interactive consumer applications.

B --> C[Block Confirmed]
C --> D[Result Available]
```

**Block Time Comparison:**

| Network | Approx. Block Time |
|:---|:---|
| Ethereum L1 | ~12–15 seconds |
| Polygon | ~2 seconds |
| **Base** | **~2 seconds** |
| Arbitrum | Sub-second batching |

For MiniGarage, Base provides fast-enough finality while maintaining a stable and widely adopted environment.

---

### 3. Full EVM Compatibility

Base is fully EVM-compatible, allowing MiniGarage to:
*   Use Solidity without modification.
*   Leverage standard tooling (Hardhat, Foundry, Ethers.js).
*   Apply established Ethereum security practices.
*   Maintain easy interoperability with Ethereum and other L2s.

This reduces development risk and speeds up iteration.

---

### 4. Strong Ecosystem and Institutional Backing

Base is developed and supported by Coinbase, which provides:
*   Trusted infrastructure.
*   A large existing user base.
*   Reliable developer tooling.
*   Long-term ecosystem commitment.

This backing makes Base particularly suitable for consumer-facing applications that require trust and reliability.

---

### 5. Consumer-Focused Ecosystem Growth

Base has become a popular L2 for consumer and social applications, including decentralized social platforms, NFT marketplaces, and consumer-focused DeFi.

This ecosystem alignment creates:
*   Easier user discovery.
*   Better liquidity for NFT trading.
*   Potential cross-application integrations.

MiniGarage is designed to grow alongside this ecosystem.

---

### 6. OP Stack and Long-Term Scalability

Base is built on the OP Stack, aligning it with the broader Optimism ecosystem and the Superchain vision.

A[OP Stack] --> B[Base]
A --> C[Optimism]
A --> D[Other OP Chains]
B --> E[Superchain]
C --> E
D --> E
```

**Benefits:**
*   Shared security model.
*   Lower costs through batching.
*   Future cross-chain interoperability.
*   Long-term scalability.

This ensures MiniGarage remains compatible with future network upgrades.
