# Problem & Solution

## 🛑 The Problem

*   **No True Ownership:** Gamers spend billions on in-game items locked in walled gardens, losing everything if servers shut down.
*   **Unverifiable Scarcity:** Digital "limited editions" are often arbitrary, with no guarantee that developers won't mint more.
*   **RWA Supply Mismatch:** Many projects oversell NFTs beyond their physical stock, leading to redemption failures.
*   **Inefficient Collecting:** Real-world collectors waste time hunting for inventory in physical stores without real-time transparency.
*   **Unfair RNG:** Pure gacha systems leave players with useless duplicates and no clear path to their desired item.
*   **Web3 Friction:** Mainstream users are discouraged by complex wallet setups and gas fees.

## ✅ The Solution

MiniGarage bridges the gap between physical collecting and digital ownership through a transparent, fair, and accessible ecosystem:

### 1. Hard-Capped RWA Supply
We enforce a strict **1:1 limit**. Digital minting is directly tied to real-world inventory. When physical cars run out, the gacha and assembly mechanisms automatically disable.

### 2. Fair Progression (Gacha + Fragments)
A hybrid model combining **Gacha** thrills with **Fragment Assembly**. Bad luck is mitigated—accumulate fragments to guarantee crafting your dream car.

### 3. Seamless Onboarding
Powered by **Privy**, users login via email or socials with gas-sponsored transactions, making the blockchain interaction invisible.

### 4. Real-Time Transparency
Collectors know exactly how many units remain, eliminating the guesswork of physical hunting.

#### 🔮 Future Roadmap: ERC-6551 Integration
We plan to explore **Token Bound Accounts** to give each car its own unique identity and provenance layer, allowing vehicles to hold their own upgrade history and racing achievements.
