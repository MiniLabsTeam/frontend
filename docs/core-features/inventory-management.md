## 🔗 On-Chain Ownership & Sync

Your inventory is a **read-only mirror of on-chain data** from the **Base Sepolia blockchain**.

### What This Means

1. **True Ownership**  
   Items are real tokens in your wallet — not stored in a centralized database.

2. **Real-Time Sync**  
   Any transfer, sale, or burn updates instantly.

3. **External Visibility**  
   You can view your assets independently on:
   - BaseScan
   - NFT marketplaces
   - Any ERC-compatible wallet

> Even if MiniGarage disappears, your cars remain yours forever.
