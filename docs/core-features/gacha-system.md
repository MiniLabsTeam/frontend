## 🎯 What Is Gacha in MiniGarage?

MiniGarage uses a **Gacha Box system** inspired by traditional collectible games.

Players spend **IDRX (in-game currency)** to open a box and receive a **random on-chain NFT reward**.

Each spin results in:
- A **complete car NFT**, or
- A **fragment NFT** used for crafting

> 🎲 Gacha creates excitement.  
> 🧩 Fragments guarantee progress.

## 📦 Gacha Box Tiers

MiniGarage offers **four box tiers**, each with a different risk–reward profile.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards">
<thead><tr><th>Box</th><th>Cost</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>🥉 Standard Box</strong></td>
<td>25,000 IDRX</td>
<td>Best entry point for new players</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>🥈 Rare Box</strong></td>
<td>30,000 IDRX</td>
<td>Improved chance for rare rewards</td>
</tr>

> `25,000 IDRX ≈ Rp 25.000` — simple and familiar for Indonesian users.
